## Features
**Neopixel LEDS:** The Iron Man Glove features Neopixel LEDs that can create various lighting effects, including a 'lightning crash' and a starting sequence.
<br>
<br>
**Pushbuttons:** The glove is equipped with pushbuttons that allow for controlling different actions. Pressing one of the buttons triggers an action, such as activating the red lasers and pressing the other activates the Neopixel LED.
<br>
<br>
**LED Lasers:** The LEDs are interconnected with a pushbutton through a breadboard, which allow you to control when the lasers are activated. This pushbutton is installed within the glove, such that when the user makes a fist, the button is activated, causing the lasers to start pulsing.
